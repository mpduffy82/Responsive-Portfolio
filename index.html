            <p class="text">My name is Mykola Duffy, but my friends mostly call me "Mick", or sometimes "Tequila", but we're not going to go into that today! I'm originally from Australia and spent the first 13 years of my life there. Sometimes I tell people that I’m from the deep, deep, south, because it’s technically true. Spending many of my formative years in Australia has been a huge blessing for me and I consider it a true privilege to be an Australian.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="text">I moved to the United States back in late 1995 and have lived mostly in Delaware.  I attended middle school and high school and some college in Delaware.  In 2005 I moved out to California and spent some years surfing and working as a videogame tester at Sony. In 2008 I moved back to Delaware to continue going to college and to save some money.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="text">Currently I work at a very successful personal injury law firm in Media, Pennsylvania where I function as a file clerk and digital trial technologist. I’m also a part time bar tender and manager of a liquor store. I live in Wilmington with my wife, two Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamute, and Miniature Pinscher. In my free time (when I have any) I like to travel internationally, take trips to my in-laws beach house in North Wildwood, go camping, take nature hikes, cook delicious food, brew beer, and play videogames. </p></div>
